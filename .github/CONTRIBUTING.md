## Pull requests
The best way to contribute is by submitting a pull request.
I'll do my best to respond to you as soon as possible.

## Issues
If you find a bug or you have a suggestion create an issue.

## Coding style
Please make sure to follow my general coding style for new features.

#### Comment everything
Every function or variable (outside of a function) has to be commented.<br>
I recommend you to use [VVDocumenter](https://github.com/onevcat/VVDocumenter-Xcode) Xcode plugin to do it easier and better.

#### Writing code
Please follow my coding style:
- Open the bracket on the same line of the function
- Open bracket on same line of the `if`, `else`, `for`, `while` and the others keyword that requires a bracket
- Separates every parameter from the others in operation (`+`,`-`,`/` & `*`) with a space (` `)
- Don't end comments with a dot
- Don't use semicolons
